# PetMatch
The project was carried out in the Advanced Client-Side Technologies curricular unit, at the University of Aveiro.
The project, built using React, engages with real APIs to access authentic information. Its purpose is to cater to individuals interested in adopting animals, particularly dogs and cats. Through a questionnaire, the goal is to pair each person with the most suitable and compatible adoptable animals.
