#PetMatch
The project was carried out in the Advanced Client-Side Technologies curricular unit, at the University of Aveiro.
The objective is to cater to individuals interested in adopting animals, specifically dogs and cats. 
By utilizing a questionnaire, the aim is to pair each individual with the most appropriate and compatible adoptable pets.
